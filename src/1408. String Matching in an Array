Hint
Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that are a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
Explanation: No string of words is substring of another string.

class Solution {
    public List<String> stringMatching(String[] words) {
        ArrayList<String> result=new ArrayList<>();
         for(int i=0;i<words.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<words.length;j++){
                if(i!=j && words[j].contains(words[i])){
                    result.add(words[i]);
                    break;
                }
            }
         }
         return result;
    }
